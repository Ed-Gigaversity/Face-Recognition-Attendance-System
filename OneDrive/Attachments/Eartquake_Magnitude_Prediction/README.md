# Eartquake_Magnitude_Prediction
# üåç Earthquake Magnitude Prediction App

A complete end-to-end machine learning web application that predicts the magnitude of an earthquake based on seismic and geographical inputs. Built with **Flask**, **CatBoost**, and **scikit-learn**, and served through a simple, elegant web interface.This repository contains a Flask web application that uses a CatBoost regression model to predict earthquake magnitudes. The model is trained using a dataset containing various features related to earthquakes. This project demonstrates the process of loading data, preprocessing it, training a machine learning model, and deploying the model as a web service using Flask.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **Flask 2.3.2**
- **scikit-learn**
- **CatBoost**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **HTML + CSS**
- **Pickle** 
- **Data Preprocessing:** Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare categorical features.
- **Model Training:** Train a CatBoost regression model using k-fold cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R¬≤), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Web Interface:** Provide a user-friendly web interface to input features and get earthquake magnitude predictions.
- **Model Persistence:** Save and load the trained model using pickle for easy reuse.
